Create a package com.company.department with two classes:
Employee with private fields and public methods.
Department that accesses Employee details using methods.
Demonstrate the use of all access modifiers in a program.

package com.company.department;

public class Employee {
    private String name;        // Private field
    int age;                    // Default field 
    protected double salary;     // Protected field
    public String department;    // Public field

    // Constructor
    public Employee(String name, int age, double salary, String department) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.department = department;
    }

    // Public method to access private field
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Default access method (only accessible within the package)
    void printAge() {
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }

    // Protected method (accessible within the package and by subclasses)
    protected void showSalary() {
        System.out.println("Salary: $" + salary);
    }

    // Public method (accessible from anywhere)
    public void showDepartment() {
        System.out.println("Department: " + department);
    }
}


package com.company.department;

public class Department {
    public void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        Employee emp = new Employee("John Doe", 30, 50000, "IT");

        
        // Accessing private field via public method
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + emp.getName());

        // Accessing default field (within the same package)
        System.out.println("Employee Age: " + emp.age); 

        // Accessing protected field (within the same package)
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + emp.salary); 

        // Accessing public field (always allowed)
        System.out.println("Employee Department: " + emp.department);
        // Calling default, protected, and public methods
        emp.printAge();     
        emp.showSalary();    
        emp.showDepartment();
    }
}


import com.company.department.Employee;
import com.company.department.Department;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Department dept = new Department();
        dept.displayEmployeeDetails();


        Employee emp = new Employee("Alice", 28, 60000, "HR");

        // Accessing private field (Not Allowed)
        

        // Accessing public field (Allowed)
        System.out.println("Department from Main: " + emp.department); 

        // Accessing public method (Allowed)
        System.out.println("Employee Name from Main: " + emp.getName()); 

        // Accessing default and protected methods (Not Allowed)
        // emp.printAge(); 
        // emp.showSalary();  
        
        emp.showDepartment();
    }
